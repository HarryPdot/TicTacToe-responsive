# Mario vs Bowser
Using vanilla javascript, css and html, the game was built to resemble Super Mario Bros and bring us back to the 2000s when everyone was on board for the Super Mario bros hype.


## What's in the game
- the game Tic Tac Toe
- a poorly created music player
- moveable characters as you win a game, this will be how you count your scores
- play again function, resetting everything to factory
- a dice mechanism when the players reach a draw
- a finale when someone wins 5 times

## Unsolved problems
- one of the biggest problems I would come back to is have it possible to play in any devices and screen resolution. currently the game can only be played in 1920x1080 resolution, otherwise you will need to zoom out.
- there are some parts of javascript functions that can be shortened to make it easier to read. One of them is the winning conditions where everything was basically hard coded to work.
