# Mario vs Bowser
Using vanilla javascript, css and html, the game was built to resemble Super Mario Bros and bring us back to the 2000s when everyone was on board for the Super Mario bros hype.

An improved game from previous version, this game is now reposive to both orientations at any size.

## What's in the game
- the game Tic Tac Toe

- moveable characters as you win a game, this will be how you count your scores
- play again function, resetting everything to factory
- a dice mechanism when the players reach a draw
